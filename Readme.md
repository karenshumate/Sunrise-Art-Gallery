# Project Title:        Sunrise-Art-Gallery

I am taking Front-end Web Development through Code Louisville and this project is what I have learned.

## Motivation

My web page is showcasing art from an 11 year old girl who started taking classes through Louisville Visual Arts in Louisville, KY. They offer scholarships for gifted children to attend.   <a href="http://www.louisvillevisualart.org/visual-art-education" target="_blank">Louisville Visual Arts</a>


## Code Style

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**How to Use?**
Download the zip file, unpacck the contents, then load index.html in your internet browser. 

## Technical Design 

The technical design of my project uses a hover and a lightbox to showcase the artist creations.
 Add images use a :hover  { transform: scale(1.2);} &
 In JS file use lightbox on images for presentation.
